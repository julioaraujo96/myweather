This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

MyWeather uses the api from https://openweathermap.org, which is then filtered and mapped using React.

This project helped me to practice the theory i learned about React and to start using some SASS features and some npm packages, when also trying to implement a good project structuring for code organization in this type of app.
